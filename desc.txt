My goal: to classify whether a review is categorized as good, bad, or neutral.

While getting reviews, I also do things like removing emoticons, convert all into lowercase, deleting special characters, changing numbers into #numbers#, also removing duplicate char in a sentence

Text data requires special preparation before we can start using it.
Using coutvectorizer for data train
Call the fit() function in order to learn a vocabulary from one or more documents.
Call the transform() function on one or more documents as needed to encode each as a vector.
return encoded vector
Using tfidf vectorizer, it transforms text to feature vectors that can be used as input to estimator
To highlight words that are more interesting, e.g. frequent in a document but not across documents. It will returns the weight of each word.

MultinomialNB
Multinomial Naive Bayes is a specialized version of Naive Bayes that is designed more for text documents. Multinomial naive bayes explicitly models the word counts and adjusts the underlying calculations to deal with in.

Another algorithms are used since i get low accuracy
KNN
KNN algorithm is used to classify by finding the K nearest matches in training data and then using the label of closest matches to predict.
SVC
Support Vector classifier
finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the classes we plotted in n-dimensional space.
Hyperplane is the line
